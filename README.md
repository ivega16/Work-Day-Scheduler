# Work-Day-Scheduler


## Description

My motivation was to create a scheduler for each work day. I built this project to help with time management. This problem solves issues with time management and forgetting responsibilities. I learned how to ulilize the localStorage so there is a record of tasks that remain on the interface, even after exiting.
